# This CI configuration has multiple dependencies:
# - You need an AWS account with a user having sufficient IAM access to run the
#   Terraform scripts and other CLI commands.
# - AWS credentials should be set in the Github repository secrets as
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. They should have sufficient IAM
#   priviledges to run Fargate tasks and Lambda functions.
# - You need to choose an AWS region and a VPC within that region. These should
#   be configured in the repository secrets as AWS_REGION and PEERED_VPC_ID.
# - The VAST deployment creates a new VPC. Its ip range should not overlap an
#   existing one in your account. Configure its CIDR in the repository secrets
#   as VAST_CIDR (for example 172.30.0.0/16).
# - The CI run uses Terraform Cloud to store the state. In Github Action
#   secrets, set TF_ORGANIZATION with your Terraform Cloud organizations name
#   and TF_API_TOKEN with a Terraform Cloud API key (for instance a user token).

# Notes:
# - This workflow interacts with AWS resources and cannot be executed multiple
#   times at in parallel. The workflow level `concurrency` should prevent that
#   from happening, and the Terraform state will be protected against
#   inconsistencies by the lock provided by Terraform Cloud. Still, if the AWS
#   resources are tempered with exernally, tests might fail in unexpected ways.
# - If Terraform fails or is interrupted during deployment or destruction, the
#   state might end up locked and subsequent runs will fail. In this case the
#   state first needs to be unlocked, for instance from the Terraform Cloud UI.
# - You can optionally set a different prefix for the Terraform Cloud workspace
#   names using the TF_WORKSPACE_PREFIX secret (default is "gh-act-")

# Set these secrets to configure the CI run
